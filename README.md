## Project3: Relationsprint

Check it out here: http://relationsprint.herokuapp.com

### Introduction:

Relationsprint was created to bridge the communication gap most couples face due to different styles of communication and expectations of each other's styles. I took an Agile concept usually used in start-ups and applied it to romantic relationships, so couples can use Relationsprints for their own "Relationship Retrospectives".

### Known Bugs:

* Heroku still giving errors on login/sign up, even though it all works on localhost.
* Working on functionality of workspaces.

### Features:

* Create account/login with unique email
* Add new card according to the 3 set sentiments of 'positive', 'negative' and 'open'
* Being able to see the new card on top of the right sentiment as soon as it's submitted.

### Wishlist:

* Able to group cards to a sprint
* Able to link to a partner's account to share cards according to each sprint
* Being able to add new workspaces for family/friends
